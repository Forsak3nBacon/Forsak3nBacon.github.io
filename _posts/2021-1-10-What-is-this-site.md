# What is this site and what to expect? The classic "Hello World" blog post
---
This Github site is going to be used to publish devblogs on current projects and things I've learnt with various programming languages.

Having just completed an extensive C# class at Uni, I wanted to put those skills to the test by learning Unity.

Previously, I have created small games using Unreal and it's built in visual programming editor but never got in to properly scripting.
I found Unreal to have quite a large learning curve, which is why I decided to move to Unity.

Stay tuned for updates on what I've learnt and tips that may be helpful to others starting out in the world of Unity and programming.
